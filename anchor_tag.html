<!--
    Relative Path
    path is relative to location of index.html (main and first file accessed by the server)
    if in above example I moved linked_page.html to a folder below the current index.html directory
    I would need to have href="folder/linked_page.html"

    An ABSOLUTE PATH is 'this specific location like C:/User/Folder/subfolder/target_file.html' 
    OR
    A specific website URL
